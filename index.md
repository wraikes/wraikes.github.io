Below you'll find some random RMarkdown files, providing some analysis on various datasets.

## Craft Beers

Here's a file that explores various aspects of [craft beers](Beer_Analysis.html).  The data is available for download at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans).  

_Note: In the analysis, I make the **large** assumption that the data is a random sample. I'm highly doubtful that it is, but I'll treat it as such just for the sake of exploration and fun._
