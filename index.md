### Craft Beers: An Exploratory Analysis

Here's an exploratory analysis of different types of [craft beer](Beer_Analysis.html).  The data was made available to download at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans).

_Note: In this analysis, I make the **grand** assumption that the data is a random sample. I'm highly doubtful that it is, but I'll treat it as such just for the sake of exploration._
