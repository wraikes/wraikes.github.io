Welcome to my humble, digital abode! Below you'll find random projects and analyses that were created for practice and for fun.

--------

### Machine Learning with Python

<strong>The following projects share the same objective of creating predictive models using Python. The primary packages for these tools is numpy, pandas and sci-kit learn.</strong>

##### I'm a (Titanic) Survivor

This [script](Titanic_Final.html) was used for practice in running predictive classification models on the ubiquitous Titanic dataset, using Python's sci-kit learn package.  The data can be downloaded at <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>.

### Exploratory Analyses with R

<strong>I find R to be more suitable for exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing and access to advanced statistical packages that have yet to be developed for Python.  Therefore, the analyses below revolve around these concepts.<strong>

##### An Inebriated Walk with Craft Beers

Here's an [exploratory analysis](Beer_Analysis.html) of different types of craft beer.  The data is available for download at <https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans>.

##### A Look into Gun-Related Deaths

This [analysis piece](gun_analysis.html) looks into the potential role different demographics have on gun-related deaths from 2012 through 2014. The data is available for download at <https://www.kaggle.com/hakabuk/gun-deaths-in-the-us>.
