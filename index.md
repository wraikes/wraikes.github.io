Welcome to my humble, digital abode! Below you'll find random projects and analyses that were created for practice and for fun.  Feel free to explore and use anything you'd like.

_Note: In this analysis, I make the **grand** assumption that the data is a random sample. I'm highly doubtful that it is, but I'll treat it as such just for the sake of exploration._
